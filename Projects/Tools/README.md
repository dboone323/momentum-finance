# Tools & Automation Workspace

This directory serves as the central hub for development tools, automation scripts, and project management utilities for the Quantum workspace.

## Purpose

The Tools directory is designed to:
- Provide automation scripts for project management
- Store configuration files and templates
- Manage CI/CD workflows and deployment processes
- Handle project backups and migrations
- Monitor and maintain code quality across all projects

## Structure

- `Automation/` - Core automation scripts and MCP server
- `Documentation/` - Project documentation and guides
- `Projects/` - Imported/copied project files for analysis
- `Shared/` - Shared components and utilities
- `logs/` - Execution logs and monitoring data

## Project Type

This is a **development tools workspace**, not a traditional application project. Therefore, it does **not require an Xcode project file** (.xcodeproj) as it primarily contains:

- Python scripts and automation tools
- Shell scripts for build and deployment
- Configuration files (YAML, JSON, etc.)
- Documentation and templates
- Log files and monitoring data

## Usage

The tools in this directory are used via command line or integrated into CI/CD pipelines. The main entry point is typically through the `Automation/master_automation.sh` script.

## Note

The absence of an Xcode project file is intentional and appropriate for this tools-focused workspace. This addresses the project structure recommendation from the workspace test report.
