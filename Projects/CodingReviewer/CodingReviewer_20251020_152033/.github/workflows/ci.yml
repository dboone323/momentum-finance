 Here's a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for the CodingReviewer project:

1. Build and test on multiple macOS versions: 
The first step is to set up a build and test job that runs on multiple macOS versions using the xcode-build action. The Xcode version can be specified by using the "xcode" input parameter. For example,
```yml
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build and Test on Multiple macOS Versions
    runs-on: macos-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        macos: [ '10.15', '11.0', '12.0' ]
        xcode: [ '13.0' ]
```
This will create three parallel jobs, each with a different combination of macOS version and Xcode version.

2. Code quality checks (SwiftLint, SwiftFormat): 
The next step is to set up a code quality check job that uses the swiftlint action to lint the code using SwiftLint, and the swiftformat action to format it using SwiftFormat. For example:
```yml
jobs:
  code_quality_checks:
    name: Code Quality Checks
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/swiftlint@v2.0.1
        with:
          lint_type: 'strict'
      - uses: actions/swiftformat@v1.0.0
        with:
          swiftformat_options: '-i'
```
This will run the SwiftLint and SwiftFormat tools on the code, and use strict mode for SwiftLint to ensure that all issues are caught, and ignore files that have been modified but not committed.

3. Test execution with coverage reporting: 
Next, we want to set up a test job that runs the tests using Xcode's test action, and generates a coverage report using the codecov action. For example:
```yml
jobs:
  test_and_coverage:
    name: Test Execution with Coverage Reporting
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests with Xcode's test action
        run: xcodebuild test -project CodingReviewer.xcodeproj -scheme CodingReviewer -sdk macosx10.15 -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=x86_64'
      - name: Generate coverage report with codecov
        uses: codecov/action@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
This will check out the repository, run the tests using Xcode's test action, and generate a coverage report using the codecov action. The Xcode project file is specified in the "xcodebuild" command, and the scheme used to build the app is set to "CodingReviewer". The destination parameter specifies that the app should be built for macOS 10.15 on an x86_64 architecture.

4. Artifact generation and deployment preparation: 
Next, we want to set up a job that generates artifacts (such as the CodingReviewer app) and prepares them for deployment. For example:
```yml
jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    name: Build and Deploy Artifacts
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Generate artifacts with Xcode
        run: xcodebuild archive -project CodingReviewer.xcodeproj -scheme CodingReviewer -sdk macosx10.15 -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=x86_64' -archivePath build/CodingReviewer.xcarchive
      - name: Prepare artifacts for deployment
        run: |
          cp -R build/CodingReviewer.xcarchive/Products/Applications/CodingReviewer.app /tmp/CodingReviewer.app
          zip -r CodingReviewer.zip /tmp/CodingReviewer.app
```
This will check out the repository, generate an archive of the app using Xcode's archive action, and prepare the artifact for deployment by zipping it up. The destination parameter specifies that the app should be built for macOS 10.15 on an x86_64 architecture.

5. AI-enhanced analysis integration (if Ollama available): 
If the Ollama AI-powered code review tool is available, we can set up a job that integrates it with our CI/CD workflow. For example:
```yml
jobs:
  ollama_code_review:
    name: Run Ollama Code Review
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Generate artifacts with Xcode
        run: xcodebuild archive -project CodingReviewer.xcodeproj -scheme CodingReviewer -sdk macosx10.15 -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=x86_64' -archivePath build/CodingReviewer.xcarchive
      - name: Prepare artifacts for deployment
        run: |
          cp -R build/CodingReviewer.xcarchive/Products/Applications/CodingReviewer.app /tmp/CodingReviewer.app
          zip -r CodingReviewer.zip /tmp/CodingReviewer.app
      - name: Run Ollama code review
        uses: ollama/code-review@v1.0.0
        with:
          artifacts: '[{"path": "build/CodingReviewer.xcarchive"}]'
```
This will check out the repository, generate an archive of the app using Xcode's archive action, prepare the artifact for deployment by zipping it up, and then run Ollama code review on the artifact. The Ollama code review tool is specified in the "uses" parameter of the step, and the input parameter specifies that the tool should analyze the artifact generated by the previous step.

6. Performance benchmarking: 
Next, we want to set up a job that runs performance benchmarks using Xcode's instrument action. For example:
```yml
jobs:
  performance_benchmarking:
    name: Run Performance Benchmarks
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Generate artifacts with Xcode
        run: xcodebuild archive -project CodingReviewer.xcodeproj -scheme CodingReviewer -sdk macosx10.15 -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=x86_64' -archivePath build/CodingReviewer.xcarchive
      - name: Prepare artifacts for deployment
        run: |
          cp -R build/CodingReviewer.xcarchive/Products/Applications/CodingReviewer.app /tmp/CodingReviewer.app
          zip -r CodingReviewer.zip /tmp/CodingReviewer.app
      - name: Run performance benchmarks with Xcode instrument action
        uses: actions/xcode-instrument@v1
        with:
          xcode_project: 'CodingReviewer.xcodeproj'
          scheme: 'CodingReviewer'
          sdk: 'macosx10.15'
```
This will check out the repository, generate an archive of the app using Xcode's archive action, prepare the artifact for deployment by zipping it up, and then run performance benchmarks using Xcode's instrument action. The input parameters specify that the tool should analyze the artifact generated by the previous step, and the SDK version is set to macosx10.15.

7. Security scanning: 
Next, we want to set up a job that runs security scans using OSS indexing and codeQL actions. For example:
```yml
jobs:
  security_scanning:
    name: Run Security Scans
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Generate artifacts with Xcode
        run: xcodebuild archive -project CodingReviewer.xcodeproj -scheme CodingReviewer -sdk macosx10.15 -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=x86_64' -archivePath build/CodingReviewer.xcarchive
      - name: Prepare artifacts for deployment
        run: |
          cp -R build/CodingReviewer.xcarchive/Products/Applications/CodingReviewer.app /tmp/CodingReviewer.app
          zip -r CodingReviewer.zip /tmp/CodingReviewer.app
      - name: Run security scans with OSS indexing and codeQL actions
        uses: github/codeql-action@v1
        with:
          db_type: 'oss'
          codeql_path: '/usr/local/bin/codeql'
```
This will check out the repository, generate an archive of the app using Xcode's archive action, prepare the artifact for deployment by zipping it up, and then run security scans using OSS indexing and codeQL actions. The input parameters specify that the tool should analyze the artifact generated by the previous step, and the codeql_path parameter specifies the location of the codeql binary used to run the action.

8. Automated dependency updates: 
Finally, we want to set up a job that automatically updates dependencies using the swift package manager. For example:
```yml
jobs:
  dependency_updates:
    name: Automate Dependency Updates
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Update dependencies with Swift Package Manager
        run: swift package update --all
```
This will check out the repository, and then use the swift package manager to update all of the dependencies. The input parameters specify that the tool should update all of the dependencies in the project using the "--all" option.

With this comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow, you can ensure that your CodingReviewer app is always up-to-date with the latest updates to its dependencies and code quality checks, and that it performs well on different macOS versions.
